TODO:

* IMPORTANT DESIGN CHANGE: Internally node and node state naming should be consecutive integers
ONLY. Facilites/functions should be added to translate node and node state names between consecutive
integers and user designated names. If no names are given, default consecutive integer names should
be used and no translation is necessary to instantiate.

* Maybe re-implement Rcpp feature functions as a unified object with different implementations for the feature functions (i.e. member functions). Send in optional arguements (dots) as a List. Null lists should ok, but don't do Nullable.

* Make variable names in ff0 consistent with ffX_C variable names

* Add in tradional Ising parameterizations to make.empty.field()

* Implent Rcpp energy functions to not need ff functions passed in.

* Worthwhile adding Latex generating functions for node and edge potentials??

DONE  * function to open implementation files

ONGOING  * Don't forget to keep adding in files for Notes links to R and Rcpp implementation/example
           files for package

DONE  * Header files Rcpp Attributes??
  cf. utils.cpp, utils.h

DONE-ish * Fast-ish/Efficient %in% function in Rcpp or C++
  cf. compare_element(), inQ() in util.cpp

DONE-ish * Passing functions as arguements. Pointers?? XPtr??
  cf. Eone_C. Use Function class

DONE-ish * tools to profile Rcpp code: memory usage, copies, chunk speeds?? Why is ff1_C soooo slow??!!
  Try RcppClock. gperftools not working right on Mac OSX..... UGH.....
  Can we do anything with Intel VTune?? -No I don't think so at this point (11-18-24).
